Exploring the ClojureScript REPL

Hi All,

I just wrote a blog post for beginner CLJS developers (like me) which
illustrates a typical REPL session complete with many of the initial
mistakes that I made in the hopes that anyone new to interactive REPL
development may avoid the same pitfalls.

http://www.alexeberts.com/exploring-the-clojurescript-repl/

It picks up where the Quick Start guide left off and covers:

-  Navigating ClojureScript namespaces.
-  The connection between ClojureScript vars and JavaScript objects.
-  Using Chrome DevTools to explore a ClojureScript app running in the
   browser.
-  Interactive REPL development.

Comments, corrections and improvements most welcome! best wishes, Alex

I love the interactivity of working with code in a Clojure(Script) REPL
(REPL = "read-evaluate-print-loop"). Understanding a few basic concepts
can help ease the learning curve and give you the tools to bootstrap
further exploration. I hope this annotated transcript gives you a
headstart in your own ClojureScript REPL explorations!

This session is based on the ClojureScript Quick Start guide which
illustrates how to configure a simple ClojureScript project without the
need for external tools (like Leiningen). If you're new to
ClojureScript, the ClojureScript Quick Start guide is essential reading
and you should read that first or this post won't make much sense.

Warning! ClojureScript is under heavy development so be aware that if
something below doesn't work it's probably because you are using an
older version of ClojureScript that is missing features available in a
newer build. Code in this post is guaranteed to work if you setup your
code as described in the ClojureScript Quick Start (which at the time of
this article is based on ClojureScript build 3162). I strongly recommend
that if you're new to ClojureScript that you start with this simplified
setup and then use build tools like Leiningen or Boot once you
understand how namespaces work and you're comfortable debugging
namespace dependency issues.

Adding to the Project

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </h2>
#+END_HTML

Let's begin where the ClojureScript Quick Start project left off with a
directory named hello-world which contains:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <ul>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <li>An <code>index.html</code> file</li>
    <li>A <code>repl.clj</code> file</li>
    <li>A <code>src</code> directory containing a <code>core.cljs</code> file</li>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </ul>
#+END_HTML

Here's what your core.cljs should look like (I've added a couple of
small things so have something more to work with).

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>(ns hello-world.core
    (:require [clojure.browser.repl :as repl]))

  (defonce conn
    (repl/connect "http://localhost:9000/repl"))

  (enable-console-print!)

  (println "Hello Cruel World!")          

  (defonce init-state {:text "Hello, this is: " :numbers ["one" "two" "four"]})

  (defonce app-state (atom init-state))

  (defn foo [a b]
    (* a b))

  (defn bar [d e]
    (+ d e))
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

I've setup a GitHub repo with the code ready to go (remember to copy the
standalone cljs.jar file into the top-level /hello-world/ directory if
you clone the repo or nothing will work!).

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <h2>
#+END_HTML

Starting the ClojureScript Browser REPL

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </h2>
#+END_HTML

Start a REPL from terminal.app as you did in the Quick Start guide:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>=&gt; rlwrap java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main REPL.clj
  Compiling client js ...
  Waiting for browser to connect ...
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

(in Chrome go to: http://localhost:9000) and then in the REPL you just
started you should see:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>Watch compilation log available at: out/watch.log
  To quit, type: :cljs/quit</pre>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <div class="highlight">
#+END_HTML

If you don't see the Watch compilation log message right away try
refreshing your browser - depending on your configuration it can take a
couple of tries to establish a connection.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </div>
#+END_HTML

If you got the ready message, Congrats! You've now got a REPL connected
to your browser.

Now that we have a basic REPL setup, let's take a moment to understand
how the browser REPL system works:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <ol>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <li>The <code>java</code> command starts a Java Virtual Machine in terminal.app and loads the ClojureScript jar file (which contains the prebuilt ClojureScript core).</li>
    <li>The Clojure main function is invoked and using the information in the <code>repl.clj</code> file it compiles the ClojureScript code including the <code>hello-world/src/core.cljs</code> file into JavaScript and copies it into the <code>out</code> directory.</li>
    <li>A basic web server is started on your <code>localhost</code> and waits for connections on port 9000.</li>
    <li>The ClojureScript REPL server is started in JVM and waits for a connection from the browser (the REPL client).</li>
    <li>When a browser connects to <code>http://localhost:9000</code> the server delivers the JavaScript files, including:
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <ul>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <li>The Google Closure library which is responsible for JavaScript dependency management and optimizing JavaScript compliation. (note that this is "closure" not "clojure").</li>
    <li>The compiled ClojureScript core library (originally contained in the <code>cljs.jar</code>).</li>
    <li>The compiled files for your program.</li>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </ul>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </li>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <li>ClojureScript code typed into the REPL is compiled to JavaScript by the JVM running in the terminal.</li>
    <li>The JavaScript code is sent to browser REPL client for execution over port 9000.</li>
    <li>The result is sent back to the REPL server in the terminal and displayed.</li>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </ol>
#+END_HTML

First Explorations

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </h2>
#+END_HTML

OK, so now we know the how data flows from the terminal to the browser
and back again, let's figure out how to get around in the REPL.

Having a mental model of your current "location" in the REPL and how to
access the vars and functions available is the key to using the REPL
effectively. Our first goal then, is to find out which vars are
available and how to call them.

When the REPL starts up we're put into the default REPL namespace which
is cljs.user. The first time you fire up the REPL cljs.user is empty but
it does have some basic functions defined that have been brought in from
the cljs.repl namespace. The first function we'll use is dir which
prints a sorted directory of public vars in a namespace. Let's try it
out:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (dir cljs.user)
  nil</pre>
#+END_HTML

Well, that's not much help is it? What's going on here? Like the Clojure
function of the same name, dir is showing us the functions that are
defined in the namespace cljs.user. Since there are no functions in this
namespace we're not seeing anything displayed in the REPL. Note that dir
prints only the functions and vars in the specified namespace and not
"all the functions available in all namespaces". If we define a new var
in the cljs.user namespace then we can use dir to see that it's there:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (def avariable :foo)
  :foo
  cljs.user=&gt; (dir cljs.user)
  avariable
  nil
  cljs.user=&gt; avariable
  :foo
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

So far so good. So how do we access code in another namespace like the
vars or functions in our hello-world application? To access these
functions we first need to require the namespace:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (require '[hello-world.core :as hello])
  nil</pre>
#+END_HTML

...and now we can explore the vars in the loaded namespace
hello-world.core

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (dir hello-world.core)
  app-state
  bar
  conn
  foo
  init-state
  nil
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Cool! You'll recognize the functions from the file
hello-world/src/hello-world/core.cljs. Next, let's interact with our
application as it is running in the browser:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; app-state
  WARNING: Use of undeclared Var cljs.user/app-state at line 1 &lt;cljs REPL&gt;
  nil</pre>
#+END_HTML

Bleck... why didn't that work? The hint is in this part of the error:
...cljs.user/app-state. The call fails because we're currently in the
cljs.user namespace and we're trying to call a var in the
hello-world.core namespace.

Let's try that again using the fully qualified name:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (hello-world.core/app-state)
  TypeError: hello_world.core.app_state.call is not a function
  TypeError: hello_world.core.app_state.call is not a function
  ... elided ...
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Crap. Still not working. What's wrong? The hint is
"...hello\_world.core.app\_state.call is not a function. This call fails
because we're trying to call the atom app\_state as if it were a
function. (ClojureScript is a lisp and assumes that the first item
inside a set of parens is a function to be evaluated).

To get the contents of a var or atom at the REPL just use the name
without parens:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; hello-world.core/app-state
  #&lt;Atom: {:text "Hello, this is: ", :numbers ["one" "two" "four"]}&gt;
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Yay! Alternatively we can switch to the namespace with in-ns and call
the unqualified var name:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (in-ns hello-world.core)
  java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: nth not supported on this type: Symbol
  at clojure.lang.RT.nthFrom(RT.java:857)
  at clojure.lang.RT.nth(RT.java:807)
  ... elided ....
  at clojure.main.main(main.java:37)
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Arrgh!! Balls. Now what's happening? Turns out that in-ns (unlike dir)
takes a quoted namespace name like so: (notice the quote symbol before
hello-world.core)

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (in-ns 'hello-world.core)
  nil
  hello-world.core=&gt; app-state
  #&lt;Atom: {:text "Hello, this is: ", :numbers ["one" "two" "four"]}&gt;
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

So how do we know if a function takes a quoted symbol or not? I'm not
sure... I will pose the question to a more experienced cljs developer
and update when I know more.

Anyway, onwards! Let's switch back to cljs.user so we have access to the
REPL functions for the next step.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>hello-world.core=&gt; (in-ns 'cljs.user)</pre>
#+END_HTML

Let's make a change to our application's app-state:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt;(swap! hello-world.core/app-state assoc :player1 "bob")
  {:text "Hello, this is: ", :numbers ["one" "two" "four"], :player1 "bob"}</pre>
#+END_HTML

And if we query app-state we see that it did, indeed, update:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; hello-world.core/app-state
  #&lt;Atom: {:text "Hello, this is: ", :numbers ["one" "two" "four"], :player1 "bob"}&gt;</pre>
#+END_HTML

Fun! Now's a good time to see what's happening in the browser...

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <h2>
#+END_HTML

Browser Explorations

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </h2>
#+END_HTML

In the Chrome tab where your application is running (i.e. the tab that
loaded http://localhost:9000), open devtools (menu item: View ->
Developer -> Developer Tools) and select the "Console" tab.

At the prompt start typing hello. The console should complete
"hello\_world" for you indicating that it's an object in the global
JavaScript namespace and which is "known" to Chrome.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <div class="highlight">
#+END_HTML

(Notice that the original dash in hello-world has been turned into an
underscore "\_". This is a feature of the ClojureScript compiler and
happens to all names that contain dashes).

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </div>
#+END_HTML

The JavaScript object equivalent of our ClojureScript var is:
hello\_world.core.app\_state but instead of a ClojureScript atom it's a
JavaScript object of type "cljs.core.Atom" which we can see if we invoke
the object in Dev Tools:

Exploring ClojureScript Core Namespaces

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </h2>
#+END_HTML

So we've seen how to access your ClojureScript vars from the REPL and
where they are and what they look like in the browser. Now let's explore
what other namespaces we have to play with.

While there's no simple command like Clojure's all-ns to show all
namespaces at the ClojureScript REPL[1], a little digging into the
internals of ClojureScript will turn up what we're looking for. Chrome
Devtools is helpful again in this case:

The ClojureScript functions are contained in the cljs object. Start
typing 'cljs' in the DevTools console. You should see a list of
JavaScript objects that are available in the global JavaScript namespace
(if you don't see a popup, try refreshing the browser page).

In addition to the native JavaScript functions associated with the
"cljs" object (valueOf etc.) we also find:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <ul>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <li>core</li>
    <li>repl</li>
    <li>pprint</li>
    <li>user</li>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </ul>
#+END_HTML

We already know about the cljs.user namespace so let's explore the
cljs.repl namespace from our ClojureScript REPL. Go back to your
terminal and type:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (dir cljs.repl)
  apropos
  dir
  doc
  err-out
  find-doc
  print-doc
  pst
  source
  nil</pre>
#+END_HTML

Interesting. Here we see our old friend dir and other useful functions
that are automatically required into the cljs.usernamespace when the
browser REPL starts up. doc is essential for learning the ClojureScript
core functions:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (doc reduce)
  -------------------------
  cljs.core/reduce
  ([f coll] [f val coll])
  f should be a function of 2 arguments. If val is not supplied,
  returns the result of applying f to the first 2 items in coll, then
  applying f to that result and the 3rd item, etc. If coll contains no
  items, f must accept no arguments as well, and reduce returns the
  result of calling f with no arguments. If coll has only 1 item, it
  is returned and f is not called. If val is supplied, returns the
  result of applying f to val and the first item in coll, then
  applying f to that result and the 2nd item, etc. If coll contains no
  items, returns val and f is not called.
  nil</pre>
#+END_HTML

And find-doc is great if you don't quite know which function you're
looking for.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (find-doc "reduce")
  -------------------------
  -kv-reduce
  ([coll f init])
  Reduces an associative collection and returns the result. f should be
  a function that takes three arguments.
  -------------------------
  -reduce
  ([coll f] [coll f start])
  f should be a function of 2 arguments. If start is not supplied,
  returns the result of applying f to the first 2 items in coll, then
  applying f to that result and the 3rd item, etc.
  -------------------------
  ... and a ton of other stuff (elided)...
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

So, what's available in cljs.core?

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (dir cljs.core)
  *
  *1
  *2
  *3
  *ClojureScript-version*

#+END_HTML

Whoa billy. That's a lot of stuff.. you've probably figured out already
that's where the bulk of the ClojureScript functions live. Ok, so what
happens if you add a new function to hello-world.core and want to make
it available in the running browser environment? Let's try it!

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <h2>
#+END_HTML

Interactive REPL Development

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </h2>
#+END_HTML

To me interacting with your running application is what REPL-driven
development is what it's all about.

Let's add a simple function to our hello-world.core namespace by editing
the core.cljs file. In your editor add something like the following
simple function:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>(defn bing [n d]
  (/ n d))
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Save the file. Because we have the :watch option specified in repl.clj
the file should be compiled automatically. Now go back to the REPL to
check if it's in the namespace:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (dir hello-world.core)
  app-state
  bar
  bing
  conn
  foo
  init-state
  nil
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Great! now let's use it:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (hello-world.core/bing 10 5)
  TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined
  TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined
  ... elided ...
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Bugger.. what happened? If we go back to the browser and inspect the
hello\_world.core object we see that the bing object isn't there:

However, if we refresh the browser and we inspect the var again we see
that bing is now available in the hello\_world.core object:

And if we try to call it from the REPL everything works as expected:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (hello-world.core/bing 10 5)
  2
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

But be aware that if you refresh the page, the browser will re-download
your application from scratch and any in-memory vars that you updated
from the REPL will be blown-away (not what we want).

Remember when we updated the app-state with a :player1 key? Well, it's
not there anymore:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; hello-world.core/app-state
  #&lt;Atom: {:text "Hello, this is: ", :numbers ["one" "two" "four"]}&gt;
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Damn. Luckily there's an easy way to update the application while it's
running in the browser. Just use the :reload option in the require
function like so:

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre>cljs.user=&gt; (require '[hello-world.core :as hello] :reload)
  nil
  </pre>
#+END_HTML

Whenever you modify and then save a ClojureScript source file that is
being watched (in our case any cljs file in the src directory) you will
need to require the namespace again with the :reload keyword to make it
available in the execution environment (in our case, the browser). The
:reload option appears to be quite smart and maintains the browers
internal state so functions defined before the reload are available
after the reload (but I'm not 100% certain so don't quote me on that).

I hope you've enjoyed this romp through the ClojureScript REPL and it
helps you with your own explorations. We're only just scratching the
surface of what's possible but you now have the tools you need to figure
out more advanced interactions. Comments, corrections and suggestions
for improvements welcome! Happy trails.

[1] While ClojureScript does implement a function called all-ns in the
cljs.analyzer.api namespace it's for use by the ClojureScript compiler
and not available at the ClojureScript REPL. It's possible there may be
an all-ns available from cljs.repl in the future.
